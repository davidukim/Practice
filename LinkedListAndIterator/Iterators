Interface Iterator<E>

When is Iterator used in Java ? 
  - To traverse the Collection (Going through the collection from initial index until the last)  --->  index[0], index[1], ... , index[size()-1]
  - To access the Data Element in the collection.
  - To delete the Data Element in the collection. 
  
3 Types of Iterator in Java : 
  [1] Enumeration : Used for Legacy classes such as Vector and Hashtable. 
      Limitations >> Cannot perform remove operation. Only forward iteration possible. 
      
  [2] Java Iterator : Can be applied on any collection object, thus general(universal). Can Read & Remove elements 
      Limitations >> Iteration only in forward direction possible. Replacement and addition is not possible. 
  
  [3] ListIterator : Only applicable when there is list implemented classes , e.g. ArrayList, LinkedList.  Enables bi-directional iteration.
